# [Ask Islam](http://www.askislam.org/) Web Scraping

## Background
Part of my ***Philiosohy of Life*** is greatly inspired by [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Tahir_Ahmad) great man. I wanted to further enhance my ***Philiosohy of Life*** by listening more to his great wisdom. [This](http://www.askislam.org/) website has about **1120** different questions and answers about all aspects of life. All this content is available in `.mp3` format. <br>
<br>
Now I wanted to ***download*** this using some sort of script instead of mnaully downloading each `.mp3` which will take forever ðŸ™„ and never mind originisation of the content.

## Step 1: Organise all questions in one `json` file for each category
[This](http://www.askislam.org/concepts/god/index.html) is an example of a category page. In this examaple category is: [Home](http://www.askislam.org/index.html)  >  [Concepts](http://www.askislam.org/concepts/index.html)  >  God

Run the following code in **`Developer Tools`** for each category:
```js
function copyTextToClipboard(text) {
    var textArea = document.createElement("textarea");
    textArea.value = text;

    // Avoid scrolling to bottom
    textArea.style.top = "0";
    textArea.style.left = "0";
    textArea.style.position = "fixed";

    document.body.appendChild(textArea);
    textArea.focus();
    textArea.select();

    try {
        var successful = document.execCommand('copy');
        var msg = successful ? 'successful' : 'unsuccessful';
        console.log('Fallback: Copying text command was ' + msg);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Fallback: Oops, unable to copy', err);
    }

    document.body.removeChild(textArea);
}

function run() {

    if ( window.issues ) {

        let children = Array.from(
            document
            .getElementById("issues")
            .firstElementChild
            .children
        )
        let catgory = document.
        getElementsByClassName("breadcrumb-navigation")[0].
        innerText

        let json = { [catgory] : [] }

        for ( let c = 0; c < children.length; c++ ) {

            json[catgory].push({
                question: children[ c ].innerText,
                url: children[ c ].firstElementChild.href
            })

        }

        copyTextToClipboard( JSON.stringify( json, null, 4) )
        return json

    }

}
run()
```
This will copy a `JSON` object like below:

```
This above `JSON` needs to be copied and pasted into one big `JSON` file.

## Step 2: Repeat step 1 for each category
There is about 136 categories, some categories within categories but it should take about an hour or so. 

## Step 3: Check that big `JSON` file is correct format
At this point your big `JSON` file should refelect something like below:
```json
{
    "Concepts": [
        {
            "question": "What is Islamâ€™s view about the differing philosophies of Determinism and Existentialism?",

        },
        {
            "question": "Why do angels take a human form when they appear to people?",
            "url": "http://www.askislam.org/concepts/angels/question_397.html"
        },
        ...
    ],
    "Concepts > Conscience": [
    {
        "question": "Is the conscience implanted by God or created by society?",
        "url": "http://www.askislam.org/concepts/conscience/question_23.html"
    }],
    "Concepts > Creation": [
        {
            "question": "What is Islamâ€™s view of the Christian Creationists?",
            "url": "http://www.askislam.org/concepts/creation/question_21.html"

        {

        },
        ...
    ],
    "Concepts > Destiny": [{
            "question": "Why does God test us if He already knows what the outcome will be?",
            "url": "http://www.askislam.org/concepts/destiny/question_120.html"
        },
        {
            "question": "What is Islamâ€™s concept of destiny?",
            "url": "http://www.askislam.org/concepts/destiny/question_336.html"
        },
        ...
    ],
    "Concepts > Doomsday": [{
            "question": "How can the victory of Islam be glorious when it will come after the destruction of the known civilizations?",
            "url": "http://www.askislam.org/concepts/doomsday/question_195.html"
        },

        }
        ...
    ]
}
``` 

## Step 4: Unflat the `JSON` file into categories within categories ...
You will notice that at this point the big `JSON` file is catgorized but partially. Categories must represent a **tree structure** or **hierachical structure** because this massively helps with organisation of content.

Copy that `JSON` file into **`Developer Tools`** or can also do it in **`Node.js`**
Run this on that `JSON`

*Please note*: **This is not the best and most efficent way to do it**. Because it is one-off it is not worth the effort to spend time coming up with a better algorithm because it will only run once and that is all. 

*Side note*: ***When trying to find the best solution. It is important to first `code` it with hand a working solution irrespective of performance. Optimisation comes later.***

```
## Step 5: Check that `JSON` generated by `reformatData` and `categorize` is fully in tree or hierachical format. 
It should be in this format:
```json
{
    "Concepts": {
        "questions": [
            {
                "question": "What is Islamâ€™s view about the differing philosophies of Determinism and Existentialism?",
                "url": "http://www.askislam.org/concepts/question_173.html",
            },

                },
                {

                },
                ...
            ]
        },
        "Afterlife": {
            "questions": [
                {
                    "question": "Did Muhammad say that children who die in childhood will be gathered in a place called Maidan-i-Hashr and then a prophet will be sent to them there, and that those who accept the prophet will go to Heaven?",
                    "url": "http://www.askislam.org/concepts/afterlife/question_72.html",
                },
                {
                    "question": "Is it possible to make contact with the spirits of the deceased?",
                    "url": "http://www.askislam.org/concepts/afterlife/question_86.html",

                {
                    "question": "When the Quran refers to \"a punishment in the grave\" is it reffering to the physical grave or to something else?",
                    "url": "http://www.askislam.org/concepts/afterlife/question_162.html",
                },
                ...
            ]
        },
        ...
    }
}
``` 

## Step 6: Follow the automated process

At this point the `JSON` file will be structured and formatted.
Run `node index.js` and it will do the following for you automatically.

 1. Add much more metadata to each question such as the length of it and most importantly get the `.mp3` link for each question.
 2. It does this by individually scraping the extracted `url` for each question.
 3. Once `.mp3` links added to each question and metadata added, it visists each `.mp3` link of each question and saves the `mp3` file in the present directory and in the correct folder as well as naming each file with the actual question

## Step 7: All done and you can do whatever you want to do with the scrapped data.
if something did not go to plan - repeat Step 6 until resolved.
